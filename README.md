### Dia dhuit 👋

My name is Owen! I am an Irish astrophysicist currently working as a research assistant at the University of Berkeley in the SETI research centre! 

- 👽 I’m currently working on looking for signs of ET through techno-signature searches using low-frequency arrays (LOFAR) stations in Sweden, Ireland and France.  
- 🪐 My research interests are in the extremes of our universe. Using astronomical transients to help solve open questions about the cosmos. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Julia, C and Space Mission Design
